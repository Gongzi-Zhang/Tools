# adduser
the --disabled-passwd option will not set a password, meaning no password is legal (so you can't login through GUI Login), but login is still possible (e.g. with SSH RSA keys)

To create an user without a password, use passwd -d user after the user is created to make the password empty. Note not all systems allow users with empty password to log in.

-k  prevents possible copying of files from a skeleton dir. by changing 
    the input location to the null device
-p  --password PASSWORD
-s  default shell
