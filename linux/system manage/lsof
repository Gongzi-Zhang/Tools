#
List open files of a process. 
This command outputs a detailed table of all currently
open files and gives info about their owner, size, the processes 
associated with them, and more. 

The -i option lists open network socket files, and this can help trace
intrusion or hack attempts.

lsof -ni

lsof -u root -a -U  # list all socket files opened by processes owned by root.
lsof +d /dev	# ls all opened devices
