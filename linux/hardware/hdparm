# hardware parameters

hdparm [OPTIONS] device	# for IDE devices only

-i  
    show device info
-I
    same as -i, but in a different format
-t 
    test device reading speed. For meaningful results, this operation
    should be repeated 2-3 times on an otherwise inactive system 
    (no other active processes) with at least a couple of megabytes 
    of free memory. This displays the speed of reading through the 
    buffer cache to the disk without any prior caching of data.)
-T
    same as -t option, but it reading directly from the Linux buffer
    cache without disk access.
