ICMP: Internet Control Message Protocol, a protocol based on Linker-layer(I think, the layer under the TCP/IP)
Broadcast an ICMP ECHO_REQUEST packet to another machine, either on a 
local or remote network. This is a diagnostic tool for testing network 
connections, and it should be used with caution.

-r  bypass the normal routing tables and send directory to a host on 
    an attached interface.


# TCPing
another tool similar to 'ping', but based on TCP. It can even specify the port to detect.
