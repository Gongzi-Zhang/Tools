Domain Information Groper. Similar to nslookup, dig does an Internet 
name server lookup on a host. May be run from the command-line or from 
within a script.

Some interesting options to dig are +time=N for setting a query timeout
to N seconds, +nofail for continuing to query servers until a reply is 
received, and -x for doing a reverse address lookup.

# e.g.
dig -x 81.9.6.2
