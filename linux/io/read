The read command may also read its variable value from a file 
redirected to stdin. If the file contains more than one line, only 
the first line is assigned to the variable. If read has more than one
parameter, then each of these variables gets assigned a successive 
'whitespace-delineated' string. The final variable gets the remainder 
of the line. If there are more variables to be set than whitespace-
delineated strings on the first line of the file, then the excess 
variables remain empty. Cautain!!!
