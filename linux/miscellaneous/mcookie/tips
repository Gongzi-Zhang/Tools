This command generates a "magic cookie," a 128-bit (32-character) 
pseudorandom hexadecimal number, normally used as an authorization 
"signature" by the X server. This also available for use in a script 
as a quick 'n dirty random number.

of course, a script can use 'md5sum' for the same purpose
---> random=`md5sum $0 | awk '{print $1}'
