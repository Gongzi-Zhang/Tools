##  Standard streams of data
* Linux features this concept of standard streams of data.Each program,
and therefore each process, is automatically innitialized with "three"
data streams: one input stream("stdin"), two output streams("stdout" and "stderr"), which all consists of data in plain text. 

* Standard Input: (stdin), is the source of input data for command line programs in Linux.
-- stdin end with "CTRL-d" in newline.



# unix philosophy
Modularity  -- design programs to do only a single thing, but to do it well
Compostion -- and to work together well with other programs
Silence	-- a program should, by default, say nothing other than that which is interesting, unusual or surprising.
Using plain text -- to be more easier to use, to set, and to interface.
Free --	not only monetary, but also usage.


# some less used commands
passwd:    change passwd for the current user
file filename:	display file type	
df [-h]:    check the partitions and their mount point
man hier    man page of hierarchy
